A serverless Telegram bot that converts Markdown-formatted text into clean, properly formatted Telegram messages using native message entities.

This approach avoids HTML parsing problems and guarantees consistent formatting across all Telegram clients.

---

## ✨ Features

- Converts Markdown to Telegram-native formatting
- Uses message entities instead of HTML
- Sends messages with `entities` (no `parse_mode`)

## 🤖 Demo Bot

Try the live bot on Telegram: **@tgMdFormatter_bot**

Supports:

- **Bold**, *italic*
- Inline code and code blocks
- Headings
- Bullet lists
- Links
- Tables (as monospaced blocks)

Additional highlights:

- Works in all Telegram clients
- No external server required
- Automatic deployment via GitHub

---

## 📖 Why Entities Instead of HTML

Telegram supports limited HTML tags and often rejects invalid markup.

Using message entities provides:

- Stable rendering
- No parsing errors
- Better client compatibility
- Predictable behavior

For production bots, entities mode is the recommended approach.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Processing pipeline:

```
Markdown 
   ↓ 
Parser 
   ↓ 
Text + Entities 
   ↓ 
Telegram Bot API
```

The bot parses incoming Markdown messages and converts them into structured formatting entities before sending them back to Telegram. Messages are sent with `text` + `entities` (no `parse_mode`).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/telegram-md-bot.git
cd telegram-md-bot
npm install
```

Then deploy to Cloudflare Workers, set the required secrets, and configure the Telegram webhook.

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

Open Telegram and contact **@BotFather**.

```text
/start

/newbot
```

Follow the instructions and save your `BOT_TOKEN`.

---

### 2. Fork or Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/telegram-md-bot.git
cd telegram-md-bot
```

Or fork the repository on GitHub.

---

### 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

1. Open Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to Workers & Pages
3. Create a new Worker from GitHub repository
4. Connect your forked repository
5. Enable automatic deployments

---

### 4. Configure Secrets

Add the following secrets in Cloudflare:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook verification secret |

Path:

`Workers & Pages → Project → Settings → Variables and Secrets`

Set both as Secrets.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Required:

- `BOT_TOKEN` — Telegram bot token
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` — Secret token for webhook verification

Optional:

- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` can be left unset if you do not use secret verification.

---

### 5. Configure Telegram Webhook

After deployment, set the webhook:

```text
https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<WORKER_URL>
```

Recommended (with secret verification):

```http
POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "<WORKER_URL>",
  "secret_token": "<WEBHOOK_SECRET>"
}
```

Webhook vs polling:

- This bot expects **webhook** updates via Cloudflare Workers.
- Polling is not supported in this deployment model.

---

### 6. Verify Webhook

```text
https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
```

The returned `url` must match your Worker URL.

---

## ✅ Deployment Checklist

- Worker deployed successfully
- `BOT_TOKEN` configured
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` configured (if used)
- Webhook set to your Worker URL
- Webhook verification passes

---

## 📌 Usage

1. Open your bot in Telegram
2. Send Markdown text
3. Receive formatted message
4. Forward it anywhere

---

## 📝 Example

Input:

```md
## Weekly Report

| Task    | Status  |
|---------|---------|
| Backend | Done    |
| UI      | Pending |

- Fix bugs
- Write docs
- Prepare release

```

---

## 🧾 Example Output

The bot returns the same message with clean Telegram formatting and message entities applied. For example, headings, bold text, code, and lists will render exactly as expected in all clients.

## 🏗 Project Structure

```text
src/
 ├── index.js      # Main worker logic
 └── format.js     # Markdown -> entities formatting pipeline
MANUAL_TEST_CONTENT.md  # Copy/paste sample for Telegram manual testing
test/fixtures/
 └── manual_test_expected.json  # Expected output for manual test fixture
wrangler.jsonc     # Cloudflare configuration
package.json       # Dependencies
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the worker locally using Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

Then set webhook to the local tunnel.

Manual test content (copy/paste into Telegram):

- `MANUAL_TEST_CONTENT.md`

Fixture-based test:

- `test/fixtures/manual_test_expected.json` is generated from `MANUAL_TEST_CONTENT.md`
- `npm test` verifies the current formatter output matches that fixture

```

---

## 🛡 Security

- Webhook requests are verified
- Tokens are stored as secrets
- No credentials in repository
- HTTPS-only communication
- Secret verification is optional if `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

Bot does not respond:

- Check webhook URL
- Verify secrets
- Inspect Cloudflare logs

`400 / Parsing Errors`:

- Ensure entities mode is used
- Avoid unsupported markup

Pending updates:

- Reset webhook: `deleteWebhook` → `setWebhook`

---

## 🚫 Limitations

- Telegram has limits on entity counts and message length.
- Tables are rendered as monospaced text, not native tables.
- Complex nested Markdown may be simplified.

---
